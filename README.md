## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://github.com/vitejs) - React framework
- [ReactjsExample](https://reactjsexample.com/a-customizable-extendable-and-modern-react-lightbox-component/) - For LightBox style



### What I learned

React really makes modular development easier. It has a really large ecosystem with developers eager to help out. I learned to equally use sass to style my components. 



### Continued development

Working on the add to cart button functionality. Currently, pressing the plus or minus buttons immediately adds the items to the users cart.

Customizing the lightbox further as iluustrated in the initial design.
Using modular patterns for sass styling.

Finally updated the lightbox via react modal component, with some customizations



### Useful resources

- [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/lessons/your-first-react-component) - They have an amazing react course that really helped broaden my knowledge of the useStae and useEffect hooks and props.
-[w3schools](https://www.w3schoolscom) - Always my go to site.
- [chatgpt](https://www.openai.com) - I recently began using the chatGPT to supercharge my coding experience.
- [react modal github page]('https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) - I made use of their modal component.
